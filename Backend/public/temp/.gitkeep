step 1:
    make the folder structure.
        Public folder
        src
          -controllers
          -db
          -routes
          -models
          -middlewares
          -utils
          app.js
          index.js
          constants.js
        packagejson
        gitkeep
        gitignore
        prettier files
step 2:
    write the express server
                      way1=
                                   import express 
                                   initialize the server
                                   get the request
                                   listen on port

                      way2=
                            1-  make the express server and cors in the app.js file
                            2-  connect db
                                   make a index.js file in db folder
                                       function of connectDb
                                           try catch
                                           mongoose.connect
                                           consolelog->connect , fail+exitprocess
                                           export function
                                  in index.js in src folder 
                                       connectdb import \
                                       .then
                                             lisen the server
                                       .catch 
                                           consolelog if get error   
                    
                            3-  make the routes    
                                      in app.js file import the routes and give the name in import and use in the app server 
                                                app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter)

                                      in router folder make te routes for which api
                                          import the controllers which contain logic for that route
                                          import { Router } from "express";
                                          const router = Router();                                      
                                          router.route("").post();    in post put the controller for that route                                      
                                          export default router

                                      in controller folder make  the file for user and write the all controollers for user

                            4- initialize the mongo db model and write schema for it
